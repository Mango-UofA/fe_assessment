## Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Component-based architecture
- ✅ Clean, readable code with comments
- ✅ Proper use of React-PDF StyleSheet API
- ✅ Semantic naming conventions
- ✅ No external dependencies beyond requirements
- ✅ 100% custom implementation (no copied code)

### Assumptions Made
1. Used Helvetica font family (standard PDF font) instead of custom fonts
2. Interpreted the logo slashes as vertical bars (|||) for simplicity
3. Set A4 page size as standard for drilling logs
4. Added padding around the container for better presentation

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Visual comparison with original image
- ✅ PDF generation and download functionality
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- ✅ Responsive layout verification
- ✅ Border alignment and spacing accuracy
