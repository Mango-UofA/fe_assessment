- Download button works

### Step 2: Deploy to CodeSandbox

Choose one of these methods:

#### Option A: GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "BoreDM Front-End Assessment - Drilling Log PDF"

# Push to GitHub (create repo first)
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main

# Then import to CodeSandbox from GitHub
```

#### Option B: Direct Upload
1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/busy-allen-x3cn8t
2. Fork the sandbox
3. Upload your files from `src/` folder
4. Update `package.json`
5. Test and verify

#### Option C: Create New Sandbox

2. Select "React" template
3. Drag and drop all files
4. Install dependencies
5. Test and verify

### Step 3: Submit

1. **Copy your CodeSandbox URL**
2. **Fill out the form**: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScY8vmXq1aPG6HFTCGg5pg2s-3658CajLKvDNDTFjadKHH22Q/viewform
3. **Include**:
   - CodeSandbox URL
   - Time spent
   - Any assumptions made (see below)

---

## üìù Assumptions Made

Document these in your submission form:

1. **Font Choice**: Used Helvetica (standard PDF font) instead of custom fonts for better compatibility
2. **Logo Interpretation**: Represented the slashes as vertical bars `|||` for simplicity
3. **Page Format**: Used A4 size (standard for forms and drilling logs)
4. **Margins**: Added padding around the form for better presentation in the viewer
5. **Checkbox Style**: Created custom checkbox using border styling instead of icons
